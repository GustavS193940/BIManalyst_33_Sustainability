## Our Learning Experience

We started at the 'Modeller' level, and throughout the course and developing our tool, we feel we have moved on to the 'Self Learner' level. We still have a lot to learn about BIM coordination and management to be able to better understand how and when to implement these tools in the design process of a building. Hopefully, we will be able to use OpenBIM in the future to automate and streamline LCA and sustainability tasks.

## Development process
When developing the tutorial we had present our learnings and code in a way that is understandable to others. This meant going back and re-learning our code. This allowed us to see our growth and how the quality of the code improved over the course of its development. It helped us identify potential areas for improvement and how we could do things differently in future projects.
  
The freedom to choose our use case meant that we would be able to create the tool that works best with our knowledge and experience levels. The freedom did make it harder to choose a use case, however, we believe that if there had been less choice, this would have lead to a worse end product.
The variety of tools introduced in the course felt appropriate. Even if we were not going to use a tool, having the knowledge and option to use it still allowed us to learn and find the best options.

## Feedback Summary
Based on the feedback we got, the tool definitely addresses the use case that we had defined. The tool is best used in stages B and C in Advanced Building Design, once you have a general idea of the building and are starting to assess more developed concepts. Some of the feedback we received was that a user interface and more user interaction could make the tool better. The tool also struggles with non-homogenous elements, so it will not be able to understand it if the model contains composite beams or multi-layered elements.
