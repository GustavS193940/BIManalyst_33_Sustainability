## Our Learning Experience
<img width="612" height="434" alt="76aa9086-ad7b-45d7-849d-ed4cfa3ae6de" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e4eebce-1e51-4fc1-afac-c064576570d6" />  


We started at the 'Modeller' level, and throughout the course and developing our tool, we feel we have moved on to the 'Self Learner' level. We still have a lot to learn about BIM coordination and management to be able to better understand how and when to implement these tools in the design process of a building. Hopefully, we will be able to use OpenBIM in the future to automate and streamline LCA and sustainability tasks.

## Development process
When developing the tutorial we had present our learnings and code in a way that is understandable to others. This meant going back and re-learning our code. This allowed us to see our growth and how the quality of the code improved over the course of its development. It helped us identify potential areas for improvement and how we could do things differently in future projects.
  
The freedom to choose our use case meant that we would be able to create the tool that works best with our knowledge and experience levels. The freedom did make it harder to choose a use case, however, we believe that if there had been less choice, this would have lead to a worse end product.
The variety of tools introduced in the course felt appropriate. Even if we were not going to use a tool, having the knowledge and option to use it still allowed us to learn and find the best options.

## Feedback Summary
Based on the feedback we got, the tool definitely addresses the use case that we had defined. The tool is best used in stages B and C in Advanced Building Design, once you have a general idea of the building and are starting to assess more developed concepts. Some of the feedback we received was that a user interface and more user interaction could make the tool better. The tool also struggles with non-homogenous elements, so it will not be able to understand it if the model contains composite beams or multi-layered elements.

## Future for advanced use of OpenBIM
### Gustav s193940
I doubt I will use OpenBIM for my thesis as it will focus more on individual processes at a material level. But I can definitely see myself using OpenBIM in my professional life. From playing around with it in this course, I recognise that there is a lot of potential for improving and streamlining LCA and sustainability tasks, which interests me greatly.

### Nafsika s253100
I am considering using OpenBIM tools in my thesis, as I'm really interested in automation and in approaching design through technological methods that can improve both the speed and quality of outcomes. 

I see OpenBIM playing an important role in my professional life as well. I want to explore these tools in more practical and realistic contexts and understand how they influence the overall design process, especially when many different disciplines and people are involved and need to be aligned and educated in using them.

## Wrap up
### Gustav s193940
For me, this course has mostly been about broadening my knowledge on OpenBIM and the opportunities that lie in it. I recognise that there is still much more to learn, but I am also very proud of what we ended up creating. Our tool was a rather ambitious one, despite neither of us being very experienced in coding. This meant that we had to put a lot of thought and effort into our tool, applying our limited knowledge in creative ways to reach our goal, which is a skill that is always good to nourish. I hope to use OpenBIM more in the future, but even if I do not, I think simply knowing of its existence and the opportunities that come with it will allow me to make better, more informed choices in my future professional life.

### Nafsika s253100
I enjoyed the process a lot because it connected different levels of OpenBIM in a very structured way. In A1 and A2, we were more like observers, getting familiar with Blender, GitHub, and Python. Since I didn't have any coding experience before, writing our own scripts and building a tool was definitely challenging and sometimes confusing, but it was also the most creative part. It pushed me to think more analytically and understand the logic behind the tools. 

In addition, the final reflection was also a valuable part of the assignment. It made me step back and see what I accomplished, what didn't work as well, and what needs another attempt. 

Overall, I genuinely feel that I learned something meaningful, even though I still have a lot more to learn moving forward.
